                | Polestar Space Solutions wants to provide customers with additional layers to their existing weather
                maps.<br/>
                The new weather+ service will display maps with ocean wave and current models.
                <br/>
                The existing solution is based on an list of select boxes contained in an accordion layout container.
                For the new weather layers, Polestar chose to add two more elements to the accordion.
                <br/>
                <span class="image-link" onclick="openImageModal('polestar-bw-1')">Their design looked like this</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This approach presents a number of usability issues:
            <ol>
                <li>The user cannot see at a glance which layers are selected, as they are either hidden by a collapsed
                    state of
                    the container element, or because the accordion element overflows in it’s container and the user
                    needs to
                    scroll them into view.

                    This violates basic heuristics: Visibility of system status. It increases cognitive load, and
                    requires additional
                    actions from the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first layer is selected by clicking a radio button, styled as a mechanical switch. This is
                    neither consistent
                    nor intuitive. It makes the user think: What happens if I push that button? Is it some sort of
                    filter?
                    Why is different from the other layer selections?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Similarly, the layers from the currents group are selected by pressing radio buttons.
                    This violates the ‘Consistency and standards’ heuristic, and the ‘don’t make me think’ principle.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                In a first attempt to address these problems, I proposed to add the list of selected layers above the
                accordion
                element, in the form of clickable buttons, and remove the selected layers from the selectable list. The
                accordion
                can only have one element open at the time, which eliminates the need to scroll. All layers are also
                consistently
                selectable by a select box.
                <br/>
                <span class="image-link"
                      onclick="openImageModal('polestar-2')">The improved version looked like this</span>.

            </p>

            <p>
                This design improves on the previous, but is still not user friendly.
                There are separate sliders for each weather group, and even if the system state is visible at all times,
                it is hard to read.
                <br/>
                In short, the screen is to complex.
            </p>

            <p>
                A better solution was required.
                <br/>
                The reason the selection status is hard to read is because the selected layers are displayed inside
                their proper group container. <br/>
                It would be better to move all selected layers to the top, so they become more apparent.
                <br/>
                Also, there is no need to have separate sliders for each group, as it would not make sense to overlay
                maps from different time frames.
                <br/>
                Given that the accordion headers take up so much vertical space, the accordion is to be replaced by a
                carousel.
                <br/>
                <span class="image-link" onclick="openImageModal('polestar-3')">The final design </span>
                eliminates all issues with previous versions, and offers added flexibility to navigate
                through the layer groups (Use of group icon buttons and previous/next buttons).
                It also allows more groups to be added later on without negatively impacting usability.
                The reclaimed vertical space can be used to add a filter field.
