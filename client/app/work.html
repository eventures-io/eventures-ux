                    Polestar space solutions want to provide customers with additional layers to their existing weather
                    maps.
                    The new weather+ service will display maps with ocean wave and current models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The existing layout is based on a list of select boxes contained in an accordion layout container.
                    Polestar chose to add two more elements to the accordion.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content">
                <span class="image-link"
                      onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-1.png')">The design looked like this</span>.
                <p>
                    This approach presents a number of usability issues:
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="drawing-list-item one"></span>
                        The user cannot see at a glance which layers are selected, as they are either hidden by a
                        collapsed
                        state of the container element or because the accordion element overflows in its container.
                        This is a breach of the “visibility of system status” heuristic criterion. It increases
                        cognitive
                        load and requires additional actions from the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span>
                        The first layer is selected by clicking a radio button, styled as a toggle switch.
                        This is neither consistent nor intuitive.
                        It makes the user think: What happens if I push that button?
                        Is it some sort of filter? Why is different from the other layer selections?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="drawing-list-item three"></span>
                        Similarly, the layers from the currents group are selected by pressing radio buttons.
                        This violates the “consistency and standards” heuristic criterion,
                        and the “don’t make me think” principle.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a first attempt to address these problems, I proposed to add the selected layers above the
                    accordion
                    element, in the form of clickable pills, and remove the selected layers from the layers list.
                    The accordion can only have one element open at the time, which eliminates the need to scroll.
                    All layers are also consistently selectable by a select box.
                    <br/>
                <span class="image-link"
                      onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-2.png')">This is the second version</span>.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This design improves on the previous but is still not user-friendly.
                    Even if the system state is visible at all times, it is hard to read. In addition to that,
                    there are multiple sliders, each holding state.
                    <br/>
                    In short, the screen is to complex. A better solution was required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason the selection status is hard to read is because the selected layers are displayed inside
                    their
                    proper group container.<br/>
                    It would be better to move all selected layers to the top, so they become more apparent.
                    <br/>
                    Also, there is no need to have separate sliders for each group, as it would not make sense to
                    overlay
                    maps from different time frames. Given that the accordion headers take up so much vertical space,
                    the accordion is to be replaced by a carousel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="image-link"
                          onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-3.png')">The final design </span>
                    eliminates all issues with previous versions and offers added flexibility to navigate through the
                    layer
                    groups (choice between group icon buttons and previous/next buttons).
                    <br/>It also allows more groups to be added later on without negatively impacting usability.
                    The reclaimed vertical space can be used to add a filter field.

                    VRT (Belgian radio and television) wants to optimize their news editing and publication process.
                    Some manual tasks (like incoming news classification, summarization and localization) need to be
                    automated,
                    and the workflow must be centralized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the different channels (radio, television, internet) use different applications and
                    workflows
                    to accomplish the same tasks. Some workflows require substantial manual input.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-content">
                <p>
                    The aim is to integrate these disparate workflows into a single application to be used across all
                    newsrooms,
                    for editing, and subsequent publishing to the different channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VRT is a state owned company, and is heavily politicised. As a consequence, there is a high
                    resistance
                    to change.
                    It is important to devise a strategy to reduce friction as the new application is being introduced.
                </p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Given these constraints the following strategic pillars suggested:
                </p>
                <ul class="drawing-ul">
                    <li>
                        Use data driven design as a way to drive acceptance.
                        <p>
                            Communicate this viewpoint clearly throughout the organisation.
                            The term ‘data driven’ conveys impartiality and thoughtfulness.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Starting from a minimal viable product, use an iterative process with strong feedback loop to
                        push
                        new features.
                        <p>
                            Use focus groups to centralise communication. Avoid exchanges to turn into discussion
                            groups.
                            Remind of the data driven design if needed.
                            Provide a prominent feedback button in the new application.

                            Detect which new product features remain underused (on a user profile basis) and remind of
                            them once in awhile. Provide a "do not remind me" option.

                            For each participant create cards to describe their specific Information Architecture.

                            and roughly define future milestones.
                            Draw the first wireframes and prototypes. Use the focus groups to create consensus over the
                            functionality and features to be included in the first version.

                            Develop a pilot application. This stage is the most crucial part of the project.
                            Good feedback and relevant data about productivity gains will ensure buy-in from management.
                            Demonstrate the ability to rapidly iterate, encorporating user feedback.

                    In 2015, I lived in Portugal for most of the year.
                    Coming from the northern hemisphere, I am familiar with plants
                    like Hogweed, Dandelion and trees like Oak, Beech and Birch. Most plants encountered in the
                    south
                    of
                    Europe where unknown to me.

                    Carob tree, Rubber fig, Aloe and Agave varieties, Oleander, Giant cane are among those
                    common plants that I had no name for.
                <p/>
                <p>
                    I decided to create a mobile application to document the plants I saw around me, and learn more
                    about
                    them.
