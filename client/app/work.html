                Polestar Space Solutions wants to provide customers with additional layers to their existing weather
                maps.
                The new weather+ service will display maps with ocean wave and current models.
                The existing solution is based on an list of select boxes contained in an accordion layout container.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the new weather layers, Polestar chose to add two more elements to the accordion.

        <div class="project-content">
            <span class="image-link" onclick="openImageModal('polestar-bw-1')">The design looked like this</span>.
            <p>
                This approach presents a number of usability issues:
            <ol>
                <li>The user cannot see at a glance which layers are selected, as they are either hidden by a
                    collapsed
                    state of
                    the container element, or because the accordion element overflows in it’s container and the user
                    needs to
                    scroll them into view.

                    This violates basic heuristics: Visibility of system status. It increases cognitive load, and
                    requires additional
                    actions from the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first layer is selected by clicking a radio button, styled as a mechanical switch. This is
                    neither consistent
                    nor intuitive. It makes the user think: What happens if I push that button? Is it some sort of
                    filter?
                    Why is different from the other layer selections?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Similarly, the layers from the currents group are selected by pressing radio buttons.
                    This violates the ‘Consistency and standards’ heuristic, and the ‘don’t make me think’
                    principle.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                In a first attempt to address these problems, I proposed to add the list of selected layers above
                the
                accordion
                element, in the form of clickable buttons, and remove the selected layers from the selectable list.
                The
                accordion
                can only have one element open at the time, which eliminates the need to scroll. All layers are also
                consistently
                selectable by a select box.
                <br/>

                      onclick="openImageModal('polestar-2')">The improved version looked like this</span>.

            </p>

            <p>
                This design improves on the previous, but is still not user friendly.
                There are separate sliders for each weather group, and even if the system state is visible at all
                times,
                it is hard to read.
                <br/>
                In short, the screen is to complex.A better solution was required.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason the selection status is hard to read is because the selected layers are displayed inside
                their proper group container. <br/>
                It would be better to move all selected layers to the top, so they become more apparent.
                <br/>
                Also, there is no need to have separate sliders for each group, as it would not make sense to
                overlay
                maps from different time frames.
                <br/>
                Given that the accordion headers take up so much vertical space, the accordion is to be replaced by
                a
                carousel.
                <br/>
                <span class="image-link" onclick="openImageModal('polestar-3')">The final design </span>
                eliminates all issues with previous versions, and offers added flexibility to navigate
                through the layer groups (Use of group icon buttons and previous/next buttons).
                It also allows more groups to be added later on without negatively impacting usability.
                The reclaimed vertical space can be used to add a filter field.

                VRT (Belgian radio and television) wants to optimize their news editing and publication process. Some
                manual tasks (like incoming news classification, summarization and localization) need to be automated,
                and the workflow must be centralized.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the different channels (radio, television, internet) use different applications and workflows
                to accomplish the same tasks. Some workflows require substantial manual input.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p>
                The aim is to integrate these disparate workflows into a single application to be used across all
                newsrooms, for editing, and subsequent publishing to the different channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                VRT is a state owned company, and is heavily politicised. As a consequence, there is a high resistance
                to change. It is important to devise a strategy to reduce friction as the new application is being
                introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given these constraints the following strategic pillars are proposed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use data driven design as a way to drive acceptance.
                    Communicate this viewpoint clearly throughout the organisation. The term ‘data driven’ conveys
                    impartiality and thoughtfulness.

                    Gather information about how people currently work.
                    Using participant observation, document the way people go through their everyday work. For each
                    participant write cards to document the user’s specific IA.

                    When participant observation is done, identify common elements used between participants to define
                    the
                    cards which will be used to build the new IA.

                    Use this information to distill features and milestones.
                    //TODO develop further
                </li>
                <li>
                    starting from a minimal viable product, use an iterative process with strong feedback loop to push
                    new
                    features.
                    Use focus groups to centralise communication.
                    Avoid these exchanges to turn into discussion groups. Remind of the data driven approach if needed.
                    Provide a prominent feedback button in the new application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contextual, just-in-time onboarding approach

                    Reduce friction for new users by providing contextual help.

                    Maximize empty states: no content yet. Opportunity to start demonstrating the value of the new tool.
                    Demonstrate the potential value by giving users an idea of what they will get once they get started,
                    and
                    provide an obvious way to move forward to that next step!

                    Detect which new product features remain under used (on a user profile basis) and remind of them
                    once in
                    awhile. Provide ‘do not remind me’ option.


                    Show in which alternative ways the task can be accomplished. eg Drag and drop - add to
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep look and feel similar to old application
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify early adopters and work with them to exert peer pressure
                </li>
            </ul>

                In 2015, I lived in Portugal for most of the year.
                Coming from the northern hemisphere, I am familiar with common plants
                like Hogweed, Dandelion and trees like Oak, Beech and Birch. Most most plants encountered in the south
                of
                Europe where unknown to me.
                <!--<p>-->
                <!--Carob tree, Rubber fig, Aloe and Agave varieties, Oleander, Giant cane are among those-->
                <!--very common plants that I had no name for.-->
                <!--<p/>-->
            <p>
                I decided to create a mobile application to document the plants I saw around me, and learn more about

                The app lets users to insert photographs and description of plants into a database.

                It is also possible to send a tweet with the app's hashtag for the twittersphere to respond.
