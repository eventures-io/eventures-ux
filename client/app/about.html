            I am a UX-designer and front end developer based in London.

    <main class="about-content">

        <p>
            I care about product design in general, and more specifically about service design.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started out in software development, most of the challenge in producing software was
            technical. Especially so in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, the technology has matured, and the challenge has shifted from producing working software to
            creating user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            This requires a human centered approach, very different from the traditional software development cycle and
            methodologies. The question is:
        </p>
        <p class="about-quote">
            “Are you going to push features or create an experience“
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to create a good user experience it is necessary to start from of a contextual view of both the
            business and the users:
            Understand the business goals and business drivers. Appreciate any historic context. (the why of the
            business). Distill engaging user journeys from this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            My task as user experience designer is to be able to abstract away the business goals, and map them to goals
            and
            tasks that are relevant to the user.
        </p>
        <p class="about-quote">
            “Because users don’t care about <span class="about-quote__italic">your</span> solution, they care about
            <span class="about-quote__italic">their</span> problem”
        </p>
        <p>
            This means a project is successful if:
        </p>
        <ul class="success-list">
            <li>
                <span class="drawing-list-item one"></span><span>The user can accomplish his task (Business goals are met)</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span><span>The user can do so easily, with minimal friction (User friendliness goal met)</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="drawing-list-item three"></span><span> The is process enjoyable for the user (A good user experience)</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
