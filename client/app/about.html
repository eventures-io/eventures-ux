            I am a UX-designer and front end developer based in London.
        </p>

    <main class="about-content">
        <p>
            I care about product design in general, and more specifically about service design.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started out in software development, most of the challenge in producing software was
            technical. Especially so in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, the technology has matured, and the challenge has shifted from producing working software to
            creating user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            This requires a human centered approach, very different from the traditional software development cycle and
            methodologies. The question is:
        </p>
        <p class="about-quote">
            “Are you going to push features or create an experience“
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to create a good user experience it is necessary to start from of a contextual view of both the
            business and the users:
            Understand the business goals and business drivers. Appreciate any historic context. (the why of the
            business). Distill engaging user journeys from this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            My task as user experience designer is to be able to abstract away the business goals, and map them to goals
            and
            tasks that are relevant to the user.
        </p>
        <p class="about-quote">
            “Because users don’t care about <span class="about-quote__italic">your</span> solution, they care about
            <span class="about-quote__italic">their</span> problems.”
        </p>
        <p>
            This means a project is successful if:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The user can accomplish his task (Business goals are met)
            </li>
            <li>
                The user can do so easily, with minimal friction (User friendliness goal met)
            </li>
            <li>
                The is process enjoyable for the user (A good user experience)
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        A typical process in any given project then looks like this:
        <div class="about-process">
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li class="process-item">
                    <span class="process-item-name left"> Define User Journey</span>
                    <span class="process-item-description right">Task & Process analysis</span>
                </li>

                <li class="process-item">
                    <span class="process-item-name right">Define IA</span>
                    <span class="process-item-description left">Card sorting</span>
                </li>

                <li class="process-item">
                    <span class="process-item-name left">Wireframing</span>
                    <span class="process-item-description right">Early User Testing</span>
                </li>

                <li class="process-item">
                    <span class="process-item-name right">Prototyping</span>
                    <span class="process-item-description left">Continued user testing</span>
                </li>

                <li class="process-item">
                    <span class="process-item-name left">Data Analytics</span>
                    <span class="process-item-description right">Mesure success</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
        </div>

    </main>
